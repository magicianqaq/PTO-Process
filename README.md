# Time-Axis Training Process for PTO Methods

Existing PTO methods typically do not emphasize using time as the independent variable in the training process. The following code introduces the time axis and demonstrates how to reflect regret values through the time axis, thus evaluating various PTO methods more reasonably.

## Datasets
- **X set**: The input data for the prediction model.
- **Y set**: The output data for the prediction model.
- **Z set**: The solution set, representing the results obtained through the PTO method.

## Code Idea
This code uses the classic PTO method and incorporates the time axis to better evaluate the model's performance. However, the replication results of these methods have not yet reached the expected outcome.
